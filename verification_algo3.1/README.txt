The experiments using Dum86 repeat this method 40 times to produce the parity-check equations 


L denotes the ordered table of Walsh values: L[0] is the first value, L[1] the second, etc.




For the results files:

(*) number of decoding that has failled because \hat{f}{e_P} < T for all e having the good weight distribution (assuming we filter the secret e_P of weight exactly t - u)

(**) number of decoding that has failled because there exists x =! e_P such that \hat{f}{x} > \hat{f}{e_P} and \hat{f}{x} >= T
